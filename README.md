# boxd

Somewhat eclectic Go CLI for managing files and templates in Box: 

- list-files
- delete-file
- list-templates
- create-template
- get-template
- delete-template

### Raison d'Ãªtre

Mostly just because another project needed a Go interface to the Box API and it turned out to be convenient
to create it as a separate library and then the CLI turned out to be occasionally useful. So it by no means
even vaguely approximates the official Box API implementations - it just implements some functionality in a 
way that was useful for a particular requirement.
