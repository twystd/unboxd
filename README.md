# unboxd

A somewhat eclectic Go CLI for managing files and templates in [Box](box.com): 

- list-folders

- list-files
- upload-file
- delete-file
- tag-file
- untag-file

- list-templates  
- create-template
- get-template
- delete-template

Currently supports authentication and authorisation using either Box _client_ or _JWT_ credentials.

### Raison d'Ãªtre

Mostly just because another project needed a Go interface to the Box API and it turned out to be convenient
to create it as a separate library and then the CLI turned out to be occasionally useful. So it by no means
even vaguely approximates the official Box API implementations - it just implements some functionality in a 
way that was useful for a particular requirement.
